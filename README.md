# Resume Builder

The [Resume Builder](https://ivanchernykh.github.io/cv-generator-build/) is a convinient tool made for creating resumes. Implemented without backend. Instead I decided to use json file as a configuration file. So if you want to edit your resume later, you need to download it as a json file and then upload this file into the app to continue editing.

## Problems

In pdf, by default, links don't open in a new tab.\
Application doesn't work on mobile.
